Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/holoken

I cloned the code from Google Code, because Google has announced to shut 
down Google Code soon, and probably deleting all content.

While I do not have the time at the moment to work on Holoken, I very much
love that game and I hope, that a small team might assemble to maintain
the code.

Fell free to participate!
